# Votic morphological paradigm extraction

This is a morphological database for Votic word forms and a converter 
script for feeding it to the [paradigm extraction tool](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract/).

It is used in automatically building the [Votic morphological module](https://github.com/keeleleek/GF-Votic) 
for the Grammatical Framework using further tools from 
[pextract2gf](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract2gf).
