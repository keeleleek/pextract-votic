# Votic morphological paradigm extraction

This is mainly a morphological database for Votic word forms and a
converter script for feeding it to the [paradigm extraction tool](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract/).

It is used in automatically building the morphological module for [Votic Grammatical Framework](https://github.com/keeleleek/GF-Votic).
